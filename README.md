# python-rest-api-project-accelerator

Python project accelerator that can serve as reference for bootstrapping REST API projects.

This project provides a light weight reference implementation of using Python and Flask to produce a simple REST API that returns two simple geography datasets (continents and countries under each continent)

The code here is in rough alpha state and is provided as-is and is meant to be a simple example of how to use Python to produce a REST API. 

## Get Started

1) Setup local development environment for Python
  - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial
  - https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-python-and-flask-development-environment

2) Install Flask

``` $ pip install -r requirements.txt ```

3) Run the application

Run F5 from VS Code or click run button

4) Use postman to interact with the API

Download and install https://www.getpostman.com and then import the "postman" collection and run the requests to see api data and responses
